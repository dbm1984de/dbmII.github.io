                <p><em>Life's lessons <strong>require learning.</strong></em></p>
                <p>I am an aspiring web developer from Wilmington, Delaware.
                    Born in 1984, I have grown up alongside the internet. I
                    played sports throughout my childhood. Always outside. My brother and
                    I would compete in just about anything we could imagine. Always
                    learning from our immediate natural world. We were very active. From
                    2004-2006, I studied art and psychology at Abilene Christian University
                    in Abilene, Texas. I did not graduate, but instead grew enamored with
                    the culinary life. I worked in restaurants for 15 years. And although the rockstar-esque
                    lure of restaurant life can be rewarding, it is shortlived. when I
                    was creating and cooking food, the creation was ultimately destroyed
                    as it is devoured. I soon found myself wanting to create something
                    that lasts, can be improved, is useful, fulfilling even. So I started
                    my journey to becoming a web developer in 2022. <em>To be continued...</em>
